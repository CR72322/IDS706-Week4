# IDS706 Project4: GitHub Actions Matrix Build

In this project, I created a GitHub Actions workflow that uses a matrix build to test across multiple Python versions. The workflow is triggered on push and pull request events. The workflow uses the matrix strategy to test across Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 on Linux, macOS, and Windows. 

## Project Requirements
- Set up a GitHub Actions workflow
- Test across at least 3 different Python versions
